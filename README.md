# Setup

Node 14 or more is needed.
Inside the folder do and

```
npm install
npm start
```

Go to

http://localhost:3000/

# Constraints

The component is working in 1920 x 1080 resolution and 1280 x 720 resolutions.

# Improvements

- Tests with react testing library would be great (will add them today)
- Styled components can be added to improve the styling logic
- I18N must be added to make the text language easy to translate in the whole app. And also a good thing to split content and logic.
- Cypress can be used to test it end two end.
- Maybe would be good to make an integration with google calendar to store information in cloud. Or create a backend for the same purpose.
